Repository link: https://github.com/MinaAlmasi/finetuning-BERT-billingual-sentiment

This repository forms the self-assigned *assignment 5* by Mina Almasi (202005465) in the subjet Language Analytics, Cultural Data Science, F2023. 

The repository contains code for finetuning BERT for bilingual sentiment classification in English and Spanish. For this purpose, multiple datasets are combined to create a greater training and test set. 

## Data 


## Experimental Pipeline and Motivation

## Reproducibility 
To reproduce the results, follow the instructions in the [Pipeline]() section.

NB! Be aware that finetuning BERT is computationally heavy. Cloud computing (e.g., UCloud) with high amounts of ram (or a good GPU) is encouraged.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as such: 

## Pipeline
The pipeline has been tested on Ubuntu v22.10, Python v3.10.7 ([UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/), Coder Python 1.77.3). Python's [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) needs to be installed for the pipeline to work.
